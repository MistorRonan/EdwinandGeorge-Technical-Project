# EdwinandGeorge-Technical-Project
The code I did can be found in the folders "objects" and "scripts" except anything that relates to "input" as that is an open source code library for Gamemaker that manages input made by JuJu Adams. 
This is as close to the project files I could get as possible but I couldn't upload the videos because they have too large of a file size hence the project can't be compiled here. 
If you want to play the game, a build is provided in the realeases sections
